  * This popular core nursing pharmacology textbook provides unique coverage of nursing interventions for drug therapy with related rationales. Highly praised for its organized, readable presentation, the text explains the "why" behind each nursing action and emphasizes how drugs work differently in different patients. Highlights of the Ninth Edition include new Evidence-Based Practice displays, clearly identified FDA Black Box Warnings, case studies threaded through each drug chapter, key terms with definitions in chapter openers, a comprehensive glossary, a revised art program, and thoroughly revised end-of-chapter NCLEX®-style questions.
